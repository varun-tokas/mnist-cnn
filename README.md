# Digit Recognition model using a CNN
I have made a digit recorgnition model using a Convulutional Neural Network (CNN). It achives an accuracy of 98.97% on Kaggle. It is recommended to use GPU acceleration while training this model.
It also imports the model file from kaggle, so you will have to import MNIST in a different way from the library if you wish to run it locally.
